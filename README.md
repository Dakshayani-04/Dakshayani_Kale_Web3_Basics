Web3 and Blockchain Basics: Setup Wallet and Explore Dapps


## Project Overview
This project is designed to help users understand the basics of **blockchain technology**, the concept of **Web3**, and how to interact with **decentralized applications (DApps)**. It involves setting up a **MetaMask wallet**, obtaining **testnet Ethereum (ETH)**, and interacting with a **DApp (Uniswap)** on the **Sepolia Test Network** to perform a token swap. The goal is to provide hands-on experience in interacting with a blockchain network in a secure, test environment.

## Objective
The objective of this task is to:
- Set up a **MetaMask wallet** to interact with the blockchain.
- Obtain **testnet ETH** from a faucet.
- Interact with a **DApp (Uniswap)** to perform a test transaction (token swap).
- Document the process with **screenshots** and a **reflection** on the experience.

## Prerequisites
### Prerequisites
- **MetaMask** browser extension installed (compatible with Chrome, Firefox, or Brave).
- Basic understanding of **blockchain technology**, **Ethereum**, and **Web3 concepts**.
- An internet connection to access faucets and DApps.
- Familiarity with **block explorers** like Etherscan.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install MetaMask
- Download and install the **MetaMask** extension from [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io).
- Create a new wallet and store your **seed phrase** securely offline.
- Configure MetaMask to use the **Sepolia Test Network** in the settings under **Networks**.

### 2. Obtain Testnet ETH
- Go to a **Sepolia Faucet** 
- Copy your **MetaMask wallet address** and paste it into the faucet to request testnet ETH.

### 3. Connect to Uniswap
- Go to **[Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org)** (Testnet version).
- Connect your **MetaMask wallet** to Uniswap.

### 4. Perform a Token Swap
- On Uniswap, swap **testnet ETH** for **USDC** or **DAI**.
- Approve the transaction in MetaMask and confirm the swap.

### 5. Verify Transaction
- Visit **Etherscan** and search for your wallet address to view the transaction hash.

## Documentation and Deliverables
### 1. **Screenshots**
Capture and include the following screenshots in your final submission:
- MetaMask wallet setup (showing your public address).
- Testnet configuration in MetaMask (Sepolia network).
- Testnet ETH request and faucet transaction.
- DApp (Uniswap) connection and token swap process.
- Verified transaction on **Etherscan** showing successful transaction.

### 2. **Written Reflection** (300–500 words)
Write a brief reflection covering the following topics:
- Your understanding of how **blockchain** differs from traditional databases.
- The role of **smart contracts** in **DApps**.
- Your experience with **wallet security** and **transaction signing**.
- Observations about **gas fees** and **transaction confirmation times**.
- Any challenges faced and how you overcame them.

### 3. **Technical Summary**
Include a table with the following information:
- **Testnet used** (Sepolia).
- **DApp(s)** interacted with (Uniswap).
- **Transaction type** (Token swap).
- **Wallet address** (only public address).
- **Transaction hash** and **link to Etherscan**.

## Expected Outcomes
- A working understanding of **blockchain technology**, **Web3**, and **decentralized applications (DApps)**.
- Ability to interact with a **crypto wallet (MetaMask)** and obtain testnet ETH.
- Practical experience performing a token swap on a **DApp** (Uniswap) using **smart contracts**.
- Knowledge of **gas fees**, **transaction finality**, and **blockchain security** practices.

## Challenges Encountered
### Challenges Encountered
- **MetaMask not syncing** with the Sepolia network: Resolved by clearing the account activity data and resetting the wallet.
- **DApp connection issues**: Fixed by re-adding the Sepolia test network manually in MetaMask.
- **Faucet delays**: Switched to a different faucet after waiting for too long.

These challenges gave me hands-on experience in troubleshooting Web3 tools and understanding how decentralized systems work.

## Next Steps
Now that you have learned the basics of Web3, you can explore more complex **DApp development** and **smart contract creation**. There are many other testnets like **Goerli** and **Rinkeby** that you can try to get more hands-on experience.
